# FuzzyMatch

🎯 Enhancing Data Quality with Fuzzy Matching: A Python Adventure!

I recently worked on a project to create a dataset that simulates real-world challenges in data reconciliation and matching. Often, data from different sources have discrepancies, such as misspelled names or slight variations in text. Here’s how I tackled this challenge using Python and fuzzy matching:

🔍 The Problem:
Two datasets:
1️⃣ Master Dataset with customer information (20000 records).
2️⃣ Transaction Dataset with sales data (2000 records).

The goal was to introduce approximate matches in the Master Dataset (e.g., "James Bond" vs. "James Bnd") while ensuring no exact matches, simulating a realistic reconciliation scenario for my team to practice fuzzy matching.

🔧 Tools & Libraries Used:

Pandas: For handling and structuring datasets efficiently.
FuzzyWuzzy: A powerful Python library that uses Levenshtein Distance to calculate string similarity. This is especially useful for:
Identifying approximate matches.
Scoring matches based on similarity percentages.
Random: To generate realistic variations of names.
💡 How It Works:

Dataset Preparation:

Created clean names for the Transaction Dataset.
Generated approximate names for the Master Dataset using fuzz.ratio() from FuzzyWuzzy, ensuring a similarity threshold of 80%-95%.
Real-World Application:

The Master Dataset mimics dirty, inconsistent data.
The Transaction Dataset represents clean data to match against.
This setup is perfect for practicing and testing fuzzy matching algorithms!
🔗 Why Fuzzy Matching?
Inconsistent data is a common challenge in data analytics. Fuzzy matching allows us to:

Handle variations in spelling and formatting.
Reconcile datasets without relying on exact matches.
Enhance data quality and reliability in reports, dashboards, and analytics.
